      <guid>https://bdmeter.info/blog/2023/06/traditional-building-construction-procedures/</guid>
      <description>Construction under the traditional construction procedure is performed by contractors. While they would like to satisfy the owner and the building designers, contractors have the main objective of making a profit. Hence, their initial task is to prepare a bid price based on an accurate estimate of construction costs. This requires development of a concept for performance of the work and a construction time schedule. After a contract has been awarded, contractors must furnish and pay for all materials, equipment, power, labor, and supervision required for construction.</description>

      <title>Building costs</title>
      <link>https://bdmeter.info/blog/2023/05/building-costs/</link>

      <guid>https://bdmeter.info/blog/2023/05/building-costs/</guid>
      <description>Construction cost of a building usually is a dominant design concern. One reason is that if construction cost exceeds the owner’s budget, the owner may cancel the project. Another reason is that costs, such as property taxes and insurance, that occur after completion of the building often are proportional to the initial cost. Hence, owners usually try to keep that cost low. Designing a building to minimize construction cost, however, may not be in the owner’s best interests.</description>

      <description>Process Control In order to produce a product with consistently high quality, tight process control is necessary. A simple-to-understand example of process control would be the supply of water to a number of cleaning stations, where the water temperature needs to be kept constant in spite of the demand. A simple control block is shown in Fig. 1.1a, steam, and cold water are fed into a heat exchanger, where heat from the steam is used to bring the cold water to the required working temperature.</description>

      <guid>https://bdmeter.info/blog/2023/03/portland-cement-materials-and-specifications/</guid>
      <description>Portland cement, the most common of modern cement, is made by carefully blending selected raw materials to produce a finished material meeting the requirements of ASTM C150 for one of eight specific cement types. Four major compounds [lime (CaO), iron (Fe2O3), silica (SiO2), and alumina (Al2O3)] and two minor compounds [gypsum (CaSO4 2H2O) and magnesia (MgO)] constitute the raw materials. The calcareous (CaO) materials typically come from limestone, calcite, marl, or shale.</description>

      <guid>https://bdmeter.info/blog/2023/02/cementitious-materials-and-their-classification/</guid>
      <description>Cementitious materials include the many products that are mixed with either water or some other liquid or both to form a cementing paste that may be formed or molded while plastic but will set into a rigid shape. When sand is added to the paste, mortar is formed. A combination of coarse and fine aggregate (sand) added to the paste forms concrete.
Types of cementitious materials There are many varieties of cement and numerous ways of classification.</description>

      <description>What is lightning or Thunder? Lightning, a high-voltage, high-current electrical discharge between clouds and the ground, may strike and destroy life and property anywhere thunderstorms have occurred in the past. Buildings and their occupants, however, can be protected against this hazard by the installation of a special electrical system. Because an incomplete or poor installation can cause worse damage or injuries than no protection at all, a lightning-protection system should be designed and installed by experts.</description>

      <guid>https://bdmeter.info/blog/2023/01/building-protection-against-fire/</guid>
      <description>There are two distinct aspects of building fire protection: life safety and property protection. Although providing for one aspect generally results in some protection for the other, the two goals are not mutually inclusive. A program that provides for prompt notification and evacuation of occupants meets the objectives for life safety but provides no protection for the property. Conversely, it is possible that adequate building protection might not be sufficient for the protection of life.</description>

      <description>Many of the restrictions encountered in building design are imposed by legal regulations. While all must be met, those in building codes are the most significant because they affect almost every part of a building. Building codes are established under the police powers of a state to protect the health, welfare, and safety of communities. A code is administered by a building official of the municipality or state that adopts it by legislation.</description>

      <description>For practical design, wind and earthquakes may be treated as horizontal, or lateral, loads. Although wind and seismic loads may have vertical components, these generally are small and readily resisted by columns and bearing walls. Vertical earthquake components can be important in the design of connections as in precast concrete structures. Wind often generates significant uplift forces that require special attention to vertical restraint and lateral support for members in reverse bending.</description>

      <description>What are Digital circuits and digital signals?
The study of electronic circuits where the inputs and outputs are limited to two fixed or discrete values or logic levels is called digital electronics. Digital technology would take many signals to do justice, so in this text, we can only scratch the surface. There is a place for both analog and digital circuits in instrumentation. Sensors and instrumentation functions are analog in nature.</description>

      <description>PROTECTION AGAINST WATER Whether thrust against and into a building by a flood, driven into the interior by heavy rain, leaking from plumbing, storm surge, or seeping through the exterior enclosure, water can cause costly damage to a building. Consequently, designers should protect buildings and their contents against water damage.
Protective measures may be divided into two classes: floodproofing and waterproofing. Floodproofing provides protection against flowing surface water, commonly caused by a river overflowing its banks.</description>

      <description>Lighting is part of the environmental control system, which also includes sound control and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), within a building.
The prime purpose of a lighting system is to provide good visibility for the execution of the tasks to be performed within the building. With good visibility, occupants can execute their tasks comfortably, efficiently, and safely.
Lighting also is desirable for other purposes. For example, it can be used to develop color effects for pleasure or accident prevention.</description>

      <description>Principal building stones generally used in the United States are limestones, marbles, granites, and sandstones. Other stones such as serpentine and quartzite are used locally but to a much lesser extent. Stone, in general, makes an excellent
building material, if properly selected on the basis of experience; but the cost may be relatively high.
The properties of stone depend on what nature has provided. Therefore, the designer does not have the choice of properties and colors available in some of the manufactured building units.</description>

      <description>Corrosion of ferrous metals is caused by the tendency of iron (anode) to go into solution in water as ferrous hydroxide and displace hydrogen, which in turn combines with dissolved oxygen to form more water. At the same time, the dissolved ferrous hydroxide is converted by more oxygen to the insoluble ferric hydroxide, thereby allowing more iron to go into the solution. Corrosion, therefore, requires liquid water (as in damp air) and oxygen (which is normally present dissolved in the</description>

      <description>Melt Processing Melt processing is the most important, most economical way of shaping plastics. It can be used for those thermoplastics with melting points and viscosity low enough not to subject die materials to excessive temperatures and stresses.
(a) Melt Processing of Thermoplastics: The raw material to be processed is usually supplied in the form of regular shape and even-size granules, because this makes quantity metering easier and quicker and leads to more uniform and predictable heating.</description>

      <description>Management of the building process is best performed by the individuals educated and trained in the profession, that is, architects and engineers. While the laws of various states and foreign countries differ, they are consistent relative to the registration requirements for practicing architecture. No individual may legally indicate to the public that he or she is entitled to practice as an architect without a professional certificate of registration as an architect registered in the locale in which the project is to be constructed.</description>

      <description>The simplest building system consists of only two components. One component is a floor, a flat, horizontal surface on which human activities can take place. The other component is an enclosure that extends over the floor and generally also around it to provide shelter from the weather for human activities.
The ground may serve as the floor in primitive buildings. In better buildings, however, the floor may be a structural deck laid on the ground or supported above ground on structural members, such as the joist and walls in Fig.</description>

      <description>Effect greenhouse What are greenhouse gases (GHG)? Greenhouse gases (GHGs) trap heat within the earth’s atmosphere, contributing to the ‘greenhouse’ effect and causing global warming. These gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and water vapor. Industry, including manufacturing, is the second largest global emitter of human-created GHGs. Much of industrial GHG emissions are due to the burning of fossil fuels for heat and power generation.
Why should I care about GHGs?</description>

      <description>STRUCTURAL STEEL CONSTRUCTION Structural steel is the economical construction material for building applications. It offers high ratios of strength to weight and strength to volume. Thus, structural steel has the advantage of permitting long clear spans for horizontal members and requiring less floor space for columns than other common construction materials. It also can be used in combination with reinforced concrete to provide cost-effective building components. For large industrial buildings, where the structural frame can be exposed, it is often the material of choice.</description>

      <title>Different types of Steel Grades</title>
      <link>https://bdmeter.info/blog/2022/07/different-types-of-steel-grades/</link>

      <guid>https://bdmeter.info/blog/2022/07/different-types-of-steel-grades/</guid>
      <description>Structural steel grades are referred to by their corresponding ASTM designation. For example, the most commonly used grade of structural steel is A36, which is produced to meet the requirements of the ASTM A36 specification. This grade offers a good mix of strength, weldability, and cost. In many designs, this specification alone will satisfy designers’ needs. Other specifications, such as A53 for pipe, provide an equivalent grade of steel for that type of product.</description>

      <title>How To Design Your Building Against Earthquake</title>

      <guid>https://bdmeter.info/blog/2022/06/how-to-design-your-building-against-earthquake/</guid>
      <description>Buildings should be designed to withstand minor earthquakes without damage, because they may occur almost everywhere. For major earthquakes, it may not be economical to prevent all damage but collapse should be precluded. Because an earthquake and a high wind are not likely to occur simultaneously, building codes usually do not require that buildings be designed for a combination of large seismic and wind loads. Thus, designers may assume that the full strength of wind bracing is also available to resist drift caused by earthquakes.</description>

      <description>Introduction to geotextiles Although skins, brushwood, and straw–mud composites have been used to improve the soft ground for many thousands of years, it is not realistic to refer to these as ‘geotextiles’. The important factor that separates them from modern geotextiles is that they cannot be made with specific and consistent properties. When modern polymers were developed in the mid 20th century, it became possible to create textiles with designed forecastable performance and to produce them in large quantities with statistically consistent and repeatable properties.</description>

      <description>When modern industrialization started in the 19th century, many people migrated from the agricultural area to the big cities. Public hygiene became a major problem. Human excrement and waste was discharged into open channels, rivers, and lakes. The pollution was disastrous and hygiene-related epidemic diseases, like cholera and typhus, occurred frequently. Therefore, it was an important step forward when public water collection systems and treatment plants were introduced at the end of the 19th century.</description>

      <description>Energy Efficiency Reducing your energy consumption is a great way to reduce both costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Lowering your utility costs and reducing your environmental impact also helps your factory prepare for new policies and regulatory requirements, improve your competitive advantage and grow your business efficiently.
Conducting an energy audit of your facilities is the best way to start. It will help you assess your energy usage and identify what you can do to lower energy consumption, including changes to behavior, equipment, and processes, and how much can be potentially saved.</description>

      <description>Supply chains encompass the companies and the business activities needed to design, make, deliver, and use a product or service. Businesses depend on their supply chains to provide them with what they need to survive and thrive. Every business fits into one or more supply chains and has a role to play in each of them. The pace of change and the uncertainty about how markets will evolve has made it increasingly important for companies to be aware of the supply chains they participate in and to understand the roles that they play.</description>

      <description>The process of hydroentanglement was invented as a means of producing an entanglement similar to that made by a needle loom, but using a lighter weight batt. A successful process was developed during the 1960s by Du Pont and was patented.
However, Du Pont decided in the mid-1970s to dedicate the patents to the public domain, which resulted in a rush of new development work in the major industrial countries, Japan, USA, France, Germany and Britain.</description>

      <description>Different materials possess different properties in varying degrees and therefore behave in different
ways under given conditions. These properties include Mechanical properties, Electrical properties,
Thermal properties, Chemical properties, Magnetic properties, and Physical properties.
A design engineer is interested in the behavior of materials under load which is mechanical in
nature, for the design of machines &amp;amp; structures. Any material subjected to a load either deforms,
yields, or break, depending upon the magnitude of the load.</description>

      <description>The main function of a welding sequence is to control distortion due primarily to the effects of welding heat. In general, a large input of heat in a short time tends to produce the greatest distortion. Therefore, it is always advisable, for large joints, to weld in stages, with sufficient time between each stage to assure complete dis- persal of heat, except for heat needed to satisfy interpass temperature requirements. Equally important, and perhaps more efficient from the erector’s viewpoint, are those methods that balance the heat input in such a manner that the distortional effects tend to cancel out.</description>

      <description>Fluid flow is an important part of most industrial processes; especially those involving the transfer of heat. Frequently, when it is desired to remove heat from the point at which it is generated, some type of fluid is involved in the heat transfer process. Examples of this are the cooling water circulated through a gasoline or diesel engine, the airflow past the windings of a motor, and the flow of water through the core of a nuclear reactor.</description>

      <description>DEFINITION AND SCOPE OF MATERIALS HANDLING
Expressed in simple language, materials handling is loading, moving, and unloading of materials. To do it safely and economically, different types of tackles, gadgets, and equipment are used, when the materials handling is referred to as mechanical handling of materials.
Since primitive men discovered the use of wheels and levers, they have been moving materials mechanically. Any human activity involving materials needs material handling. However, in the field of engineering and technology, the term materials handling is used with reference to industrial activity.</description>

      <description>Whenever we got a quality complaint and claim, we need to provide a reasonable explanation to the buyer how and why it happened. To provide this explanation, we need to make a thorough investigation to find out the possible root cause as well as provide the correct action plan to avoid future happening. During the investigation, we need to involve a lot of data and questions. In our past experiences, we spent a lot of time back and forth emails to collect the data and find out the root cause because either we forgot to check this or that.</description>

      <description>ইসলামী আইনে গরু/ চতুষ্পদ জন্তু হালাল উপায়ে জবাই করা অত্যাবশ্যক। গরু হালাল জবাই মুসলিমদের জন্য গ্রহণযোগ্য একমাত্র পদ্ধতি। হালাল জবাইয়ের সংক্ষিপ্ত বিবরণ:
১. কুরবানীর জন্য জবাই করতে হবে এমন চতুষ্পদ জন্তু যা মুসলমানদের খাওয়ার জন্য অনুমতিপ্রাপ্ত।
২. জবাইয়ের সময় অবশ্যই জীবিত থাকতে হবে।
হালাল উপায়ে পশু কোরবানি পদ্ধতি
৩. ধারালো ছুরি ব্যবহার করে জবাই করতে হবে। এমন ছুরি ব্যাবহার করা যাবেনা যার ওজন বেশি এবং ওজনের ভারেই জবাই হয়ে যেতে পারে। যদি ছুটির ওজনের প্রভাবে জবাই করা হয়, তবে সেই মাংস খাওয়া যাবেনা ।</description>
