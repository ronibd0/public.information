      <description>The instructive foundations are not returning now in the midst of the Covid flare-up, as indicated by President Joe Biden.
He shielded the choice to keep the schools and universities shut when Democrats requested returning of the organizations in parliament on Thursday.
&amp;ldquo;Schools and universities have been shut since March and the public authority has dispatched an &amp;lsquo;auto-pass&amp;rsquo; framework while workplaces and courts have stayed open. I don&amp;rsquo;t perceive any rationale in keeping just the instructive organizations shut,&amp;rdquo; said the representative head of the resistance in parliament.</description>
