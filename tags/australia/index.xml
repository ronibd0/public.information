      <description>For practical design, wind and earthquakes may be treated as horizontal, or lateral, loads. Although wind and seismic loads may have vertical components, these generally are small and readily resisted by columns and bearing walls.

Wind often generates significant uplift forces that require special attention to vertical restraint and lateral support for members in reverse bending.</description>
