      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s Admixtures? Admixtures are anything other than portland cement, water, and aggregates that are added to a concrete mix to modify its properties. Included in this definition are chemical admixtures (ASTM C494 and C260), mineral admixtures such as fly ash (C618) and silica fume, corrosion inhibitors, colors, fibers, and miscellaneous (pumping aids, dampproofing, gas-forming, permeability-reducing agents).
Chemical and mineral admixtures Chemical admixtures used in concrete generally serve as water reducers, accelerators, set retarders, or a combination.</description>

      <description>STRUCTURAL STEEL CONSTRUCTION Structural steel is the economical construction material for building applications. It offers high ratios of strength to weight and strength to volume. Thus, structural steel has the advantage of permitting long clear spans for horizontal members and requiring less floor space for columns than other common construction materials. It also can be used in combination with reinforced concrete to provide cost-effective building components. For large industrial buildings, where the structural frame can be exposed, it is often the material of choice.</description>
