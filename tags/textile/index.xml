      <description>Introduction to geotextiles Although skins, brushwood, and straw–mud composites have been used to improve the soft ground for many thousands of years, it is not realistic to refer to these as ‘geotextiles’. The important factor that separates them from modern geotextiles is that they cannot be made with specific and consistent properties. When modern polymers were developed in the mid 20th century, it became possible to create textiles with designed forecastable performance and to produce them in large quantities with statistically consistent and repeatable properties.</description>

      <description>Whenever we got a quality complaint and claim, we need to provide a reasonable explanation to the buyer how and why it happened. To provide this explanation, we need to make a thorough investigation to find out the possible root cause as well as provide the correct action plan to avoid future happening. During the investigation, we need to involve a lot of data and questions. In our past experiences, we spent a lot of time back and forth emails to collect the data and find out the root cause because either we forgot to check this or that.</description>

      <description>In the apparel industry, professionals always talk about product quality, defects, and quality systems. To the buyers – the end product what they are receiving from factory, quality should be as per the requirement. No more, no less. Earlier buyers don’t bother how a factory makes quality? How much extra pieces they have processed to achieve all good pieces to handover the buyer?
On the other side, factories don’t think how much money they are losing through repair work and garment rejection.</description>
