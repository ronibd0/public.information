      <description>Introduction Three basic components, resistors, capacitors, and inductors, are very important elements in electrical circuits as individual devices, or together. Resistors are used as loads, delays, and current limiting devices. Capacitors are used as dc blocking devices, in level shifting, integrating, differentiating, frequency determination, selection, and delay circuits. Inductors are used for frequency selection and ac blocking, in analog meter movements and relays, and are the basis for transformers and motors.</description>

      <description>What are Digital circuits and digital signals?
The study of electronic circuits where the inputs and outputs are limited to two fixed or discrete values or logic levels is called digital electronics. Digital technology would take many signals to do justice, so in this text, we can only scratch the surface. There is a place for both analog and digital circuits in instrumentation. Sensors and instrumentation functions are analog in nature.</description>
