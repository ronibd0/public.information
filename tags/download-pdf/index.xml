      <description>Different materials possess different properties in varying degrees and therefore behave in different
ways under given conditions. These properties include Mechanical properties, Electrical properties,
Thermal properties, Chemical properties, Magnetic properties, and Physical properties.
A design engineer is interested in the behavior of materials under load which is mechanical in
nature, for the design of machines &amp;amp; structures. Any material subjected to a load either deforms,
yields, or break, depending upon the magnitude of the load.</description>

      <description>This Complete Textile Glossary is intended to be a convenient reference for textile terminology.
Although it covers all types of textile terms broadly, its special emphasis is on manufactured
fibers - what they are, how they are made, and how they are used.
The first two editions of this dictionary were published under the title Man-Made Fiber and
Textile Dictionary by the former Celanese Corporation to provide a source for employees.</description>
