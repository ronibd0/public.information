A simple control block is shown in Fig. 1.1a, steam, and cold water are fed into a heat exchanger, where heat from the steam is used to bring the cold water to the required working temperature.</description>

The other component is an enclosure that extends over the floor and generally also around it to provide shelter from the weather for human activities.
The ground may serve as the floor in primitive buildings. In better buildings, however, the floor may be a structural deck laid on the ground or supported above ground on structural members, such as the joist and walls in Fig.</description>
